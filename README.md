# Panel Queue Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot intended to help virtual classroom management, particularly for office hours and lab sections.

For office hours, there is a queue panel for students to get in or out of line, and the instructor can remove students from the line accordingly. 

For labs, there is the same queue panel for students to get in or out of line, and when an instructor and/or TA's remove students from the line, a text and voice channel can be created to help students solve problems. The instructor and student will be notified in the text channel, and they can either use chat or voice / screenshare.
