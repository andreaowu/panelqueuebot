# Panel Queue Discord Bot

## Introduction
This is a Discord bot intended to help virtual classroom management, particularly for office hours and lab sections.

For office hours, there is a queue panel for students to get in or out of line, and the instructor can remove students from the line accordingly. 

For labs, there is the same queue panel for students to get in or out of line, and when an instructor and/or TA's remove students from the line, a text and voice channel can be created to help students solve problems. The instructor and student will be notified in the text channel, and they can either use chat or voice / screenshare.

## Usage
To use the Discord bot, [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=735918166470819850&permissions=8272&scope=bot) is the invite link.

Once the Discord bot is invited to a server, it will automatically create a **PanelQueue** category with two text channels: **queue** and **bot-help**.
